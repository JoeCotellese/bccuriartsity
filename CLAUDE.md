# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Who edits this site

Two kinds of people work in this repo: a developer, and the shop owner, who is
not a programmer and drives Claude Code from the desktop app. Match whoever is
asking. If the request is plain language about words, pictures, or how the site
looks, answer in plain language: no file paths, no CSS property names, no build
output. Name things the way the site does ("the hours", "the top banner", "a
piece in the gallery").

Editing splits in two, and the halves carry different risk.

**Content** is `src/_data/site.json`, `src/sections/*.md`, and `src/gallery/*.md`.
Route plain-language requests to them:

- shop name, address, phone, email, hours, social links → `src/_data/site.json`
- the top banner, the "Why I Do This" story → `src/sections/`
- a gallery piece, adding one, removing one, marking one sold → `src/gallery/`

Changing hours means changing `hours` and `hoursSchema` together. They are the
same fact written twice and drifting them apart is silent.

**Structural** is `src/index.njk`, `src/_includes/*.njk`, and `src/css/style.css`.
These can break the build or quietly ruin the layout on a phone. After changing
any of them:

- Run `npm run build`. A template error surfaces as a stack trace the owner
  cannot read, so catch it while the change is still easy to undo.
- Tell them to narrow the browser window and look. This site is mobile-first
  with a single breakpoint at 769px, and a change that looks right on a laptop
  routinely breaks below it. They will not think to check.

**Say before you touch** `.eleventy.js`, `netlify.toml`, `package.json`, `bin/`,
or `.claude/`. These are how the site builds and publishes rather than what it
says, and a change there fails in ways the preview does not show.

Edits are saved and undone through the `save` and `undo` skills, which keep a
history the owner can read. Prefer them over raw git commands.

## Commands

- `npm start` — Eleventy dev server with live reload (`eleventy --serve`)
- `npm run build` — production build to `_site/`
- No tests, no linter. (`npm test` is a stub that exits 1.)

## Deployment

Netlify builds `npm run build` and publishes `_site/` (see `netlify.toml`). Push to `main` deploys.

## Architecture

Eleventy 3 static site. Styling is [Pico CSS v2](https://picocss.com) (CDN, classful build) re-skinned by a thin `src/css/style.css`. No JS framework, no build step beyond Eleventy.

Single source of truth for shop facts is `src/_data/site.json` — name, address, phone, email, hours, social links, map URLs. Templates read it as the global `site`. **Change shop details there, not in templates.** Two derived facts have parallel representations that must be kept in sync by hand: `hours` (human-readable strings) vs `hoursSchema` (machine times for schema.org markup).

`site.json` propagates into generated files that exist to stay in sync with it: `llms.txt.njk` → `/llms.txt`, `sitemap.xml.njk`, `robots.txt.njk`, and the SEO/schema.org meta in `base.njk`. Editing one of these by hand instead of `site.json` will cause drift.

### Page structure

The public site is a **single page** with anchor navigation (`#home`, `#about`, `#gallery`, `#contact`). Gallery pieces also get their own detail pages at `/gallery/<slug>/`.

- `src/_includes/base.njk` — layout shell: `<head>` (fonts, Pico, SEO/OG/Twitter meta, schema.org JSON-LD, favicons), the sticky header nav, and the dark **"Find Me In Person" contact block which doubles as the site footer** (so it appears on every page, including detail pages). Copyright sign-off sits at the bottom of that block.
- `src/index.njk` — homepage sections: hero (`#home`), about (`#about`, first-person "Why I Do This"), gallery (`#gallery`).
- `src/_includes/item.njk` — individual gallery piece page; back-link targets `/#gallery`.

There is **no** standalone `/gallery/` index page — the homepage `#gallery` section is the gallery.

### Gallery (data-driven collection)

Each piece is one markdown file in `src/gallery/`. `src/gallery/gallery.json` is the Eleventy directory data file giving every file in that folder `layout: item.njk` and `tags: [gallery]` — so adding a piece is just dropping in a new `.md`, no config. Front matter consumed by templates: `title`, `date`, `medium`, `year`, `image` (optional — falls back to a titled placeholder tile), `sold` (bool — renders a "Sold" badge via `.gallery-item__sold`). The homepage `#gallery` section renders the `gallery` collection reverse-chronologically into `.gallery-grid`; each tile links to the piece's detail page.

## Style guide

Voice: **first-person, personal** ("I hunt for pieces…", "Find Me In Person") — the owner speaking, not a shop "we". Match that in any copy.

Visual system (defined as CSS custom properties at the top of `style.css`):

- **Palette:** forest green `#2d5016` (primary/accent), deep charcoal `#2c2c2c` (text + dark bands), warm cream `#f8f7f5` (background), taupe `#8b8680` (muted text). On the dark contact/footer band, links use a brighter green (`#a8d472`) for AA contrast.
- **Fonts:** Crimson Text (serif) for headings + the nav wordmark; Jost (sans, weight 300 body) for everything else. Loaded from Google Fonts in `base.njk`.
- **Layout:** full-width sticky header and full-bleed dark contact/footer band; body sections stay within Pico's centered `.container`. Section eyebrows use `.section-label` (small uppercase forest-green).
- **Responsive: mobile-first.** Base CSS is the mobile layout (single-column hero with image on top, stacked grids); the desktop layer is added in a single `@media (min-width: 769px)` block. Add new responsive rules the same way — base = mobile, enhance upward.

## Working with Pico

Pico owns base typography, spacing, forms, tables, and the `.container` utility. The re-skin works by **overriding Pico's design tokens**, not fighting its rules:

- Palette/font tokens (`--pico-background-color`, `--pico-color`, `--pico-muted-color`, `--pico-font-family-sans-serif`, etc.) are set on `:root`.
- **Gotcha — primary color:** Pico defines its primary palette under `:root:not([data-theme="dark"])`, which out-specifies a plain `:root`. The forest-green primary tokens (`--pico-primary-background`, etc.) are therefore set under that same selector. Match this specificity when overriding any other Pico primary token, or it won't take.
- **Gotcha — tables:** Pico paints tables with `--pico-background-color`. On the dark band the hours table is forced `background: transparent` so it doesn't render a white box.
- Headings: Pico has no single heading-font token, so the serif face is applied by targeting `h1, h2, h3, .nav-logo, .contact-block h3` directly.

Reach for a Pico token override or a small component in `style.css` only when Pico's default falls short — don't add a heavyweight component or new dependency for what a few declarations cover.

### Conventions

- `.eleventy.js` registers a `currentYear` filter and passthrough-copies `src/css` and `src/images`.
- Templates carry two-line `ABOUTME:` comments (per global instructions) — preserve them.
